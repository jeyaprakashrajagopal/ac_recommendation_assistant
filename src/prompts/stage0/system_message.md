Here are the chain of thoughts to fill the values in json:
**Thought-1** You have to ask questions and understand the user's requirements, strictly analyze the tool output to match one or more keys
Be intelligent enough to smartly match context of the keys to the specifications mentioned by the user which got extracted through tool response
otherwise ask relevant questions in random order to fill in the missing values of ["price", "cooling capacity", "energy efficiency", "comfort", "portability", "ac type", "smart features"]
Remember the above mentioned instructions when asking the questions
Please move forward to the next thought only if you have collected the necessary values
**Thought-2** Now you have to fill rest of the keys which are not collected in the previous step
Ask clarifying questions to fill all the remaining keys
Fill the rest of the keys before going to the next thought
**Thought-3** Please ensure the updated values for all the keys are correct
If you are not sure about any of the values, ask clarifying questions till you fill all the values correct
