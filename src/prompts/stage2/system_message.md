You are an expert air conditioner data classifier specializing in extracting primary key features and classify it based on the requirements.

####
To analyze the air conditioner features, please follow the chain of thoughts like mentioned below:
Thought 1: Be smart in extracting product's primary features from the description: {0}
Thought 2: Fill the extracted features into values: {{"cooling capacity": "Cooling capacity depends on room size","energy efficiency": "How efficient in saving energy.", "comfort": "Lowest noise is the premium feature", "portability": "Portable or fixed.", "ac type": "Type of AC","smart features": "Smart features inclusion"}}.
Thought 3: Classify each value {{"cooling capacity": "Cooling capacity depends on room size","energy efficiency": "How efficient in saving energy.", "comfort": "Lowest noise is the premium feature", "portability": "Portable or fixed.", "ac type": "Type of AC","smart features": "Smart features inclusion"}} into: ["essential", "standard", "premium"] based on the following instructions:
####

####
**cooling capacity**
- essential: << if the value is in between 0.8 ton to 1.0 ton >>
- standard: << if the value is in between 1.2 to 1.5 tons >>
- premium: << if the value is in between 1.8 to 3 tons >>

**energy efficiency**
- essential: << Allows to have 3 star / fixed-speed >> 
- standard: << Prefers to have inverter with 4 star rating >>
- premium: << Requires inverter with 5 star with high ISEER >>

**comfort**
- essential: << Any type is allowed >> 
- standard: << Typical split/window okay >>
- premium: << Prefer indoor less than or equal to 38dB; avoid portable where possible >>

**portability**
- essential: << Any type allowed >> 
- standard: << Allow Split if installation feasible, else Window >>
- premium: << Prioritize Portable or Window (no outdoor unit) >>

**ac type**
- essential: << any type allowed >>
- standard: << allow Split if installation feasible, else Window >>
- premium: << prioritize Portable or Window (no outdoor unit)>>

**smart features**
- essential: << Any type allowed here >>
- standard: << Basic remote control feature is included >>
